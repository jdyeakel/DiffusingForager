\begin{abstract}

  We outline an event-driven simulation approach for the foragin model, which
  involves the interplay between reproduction and starvation of the foragers,
  and the regeneration of resources.  The system consists of a resource that
  renews by logistic growth, as well as two classes of foragers---satiated
  and starving.  Satiated foragers reproduce at a fixed rate and are not
  vulnerable to mortality.  However, a satiated forager can starve when
  resources are scarce; conversely, a starving forager can become satiated
  when the resource is abundant.  Starving foragers do not reproduce and they
  die at a rate $\mu$.

\section{The Model}

We incorporate energetics into the model dynamics by assuming that the
foragers can exist in two discrete energetic states---satiated and starving.
Satiated (or full) foragers $F$ are those that have just encountered and
consumed a unit of resource $R$.  On the other hand, a satiated forager that
does not encounter a resource as it wanders is converted to a starving
forager $S$ with rate $\sigma$.  Whenever a forager, either satiating or
starving, encounters resources, one unit of the resource is consumed.  If the
forager was starving, it is recruited into the satiated population with rate
$\rho$.  During the time that a forager is starving, it dies with a fixed
mortality rate $\mu$, while satiated foragers do not experience mortality
risk.  Furthermore, satiated foragers reproduce with rate $\lambda$.
Finally, we assume that, in the absence of foragers, the underlying resource
undergoes logistic growth, with growth rate $\alpha$ and carrying capacity
equal to one.

According to these processes and also under the assumption that the densities
of satiated foragers, starving foragers, and resources (also denoted by $F$,
$S$, and $R$, respectively) are perfectly mixed, they evolve according to the
rate equations:
\begin{align}
  \label{RE}
\begin{split}
\dot F &= \lambda F + \rho  RS - \sigma (1-R)F\,,\\
\dot S &= \sigma (1-R)F - \rho RS - \mu S\,, \\
\dot R &= \alpha R(1-R) -  R(F+S),\\
\end{split}
\end{align}
where the overdot denotes time derivative.

This system of equations admits four fixed points.  Two of them, at
$(F^*\!=\!0,S^*\!=\!0,R^*\!=\!0)$ and $(F^*\!=\!0,S^*\!=\!0,R^*\!=\!1)$
correspond to an environment without foragers.  In this case, the latter
fixed point is stable.  There is also an unphysical fixed point at negative
densities and a non-trivial fixed point in which all populations are
represented, $(F^*,S^*,R^*\!>\!0)$, corresponding to an ecologically active
steady state.  If this unique steady state is stable, the species populations
will be globally attracted to it for any non-zero initial conditions.

To determine the stability of the non-trivial fixed point, we compute the
Jacobian Matrix $\bf J$, whose elements are given by
$J_{ij}=\partial X_i/\partial X_j$, where $X_i$, with $i=1,2,3$, refers to
the densities $F,S,R$, respectively.  At the non-trivial fixed point, the
Jacobian matrix is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}|_* = 
\left(
\begin{array}{lll}
  \lambda  - \sigma(1-R^*)  & \rho R^* & \sigma(S^*+ S^*) \\
  \sigma(1-R^*) & - \rho R^*-\mu &   -\rho  (S^*+ F^*) \\
  - R^* & - R^* & \alpha(1-2 R^*)-(S^*+F^*) \\
\end{array}
\right).
\end{equation}


Whether the internal steady state is attracting or repelling is conditioned
on the values of the parameters in the system.  If the parameters of the
Jacobian matrix (at the internal steady state) are such that its eigenvalues
have negative real values, then it is stable.  The stability of the system
changes if a Saddle-Node bifurcation is crossed, such that a single
eigenvalue obtains a positive real part, defined by the condition
${\rm Det}({\bf J})=0$.  A single Saddle-Node bifurcation always exists for
$\alpha = 0$, such that $\alpha > 0$ for the internal state to be stable.
% Although a closed-form solution is not possible, a second stability
% condition generally requires $\delta > a \exp \{\frac{b}{c+\epsilon}\}$
% assuming low values of $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$ (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are
% some combination of the model parameters), which simplifies to
% $\delta > \frac{\mu_y}{\epsilon}$ when $p=0$.  This condition places a
% lower bound on the consumer's rate of growth as a function of its rate of
% predation on the resource.  As the rate of consumption decreases, system is
% more likely to become unstable if the consumer's rate of reproduction
% declines.

Of more interest here is the existence of parameter regions that permit the
existence of cyclic behavior.  Cycles arise when a pair of complex conjugate
eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis and attain positive real parts.  This
condition is called a Hopf bifurcation, and is defined by
${\rm Det}({\bf S}) = 0$, where $\bf S$ is the Sylvester matrix, which is
composed of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial describing the
Jacobian matrix.  Although the Hopf condition cannot be solved analytically
for the specific 2-stage model, it can be explored numerically.

\section{Results}

To determine how the consumer-resource system impacted by different rates of starvation, we analyze the systems with respect to $p$.
