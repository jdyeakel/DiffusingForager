  The eco-evolutionary dynamics of species is fundamentally linked to the
energetic constraints of its constituent individuals. Of particular importance
are the tradeoffs between reproduction and the dynamics of starvation and
recovery in resource-limited environments. To elucidate the consequences of
this tradeoff, we introduce a minimal nutritional state-structured model that
incorporates two classes of consumer: nutritionally replete consumers that
reproduce, and undernourished, non-reproducing consumers that are susceptible
to mortality. As a function of the transition rates between these replete and
undernourished states that are determined by the presence or absence of
resources, the consumer populations can either undergo cyclic dynamics or reach
a steady state. We obtain strong constraints on starvation and recovery rates
by deriving allometric scaling relationships and find that population dynamics
subject to these constraints can approach the cyclic regime but are typically
driven to a steady state. Moreover, we find that these rates fall within a
`refuge' in parameter space, where the probability of extinction of the
consumer population is minimized. Thus we identify a potential mechanism that
may both drive and constrain the dynamics of animal populations. Our model
provides a natural framework that predicts maximum body size for mammals by
determining the relative stability of an otherwise homogeneous population to a
mutant population with altered percent body fat. For body masses $\lesssim
10^7$g, individuals with increased energetic reserves can invade resident
populations, and vice versa for body mass $\gtrsim 10^7$g, thus providing a
principled mechanism for a within-lineage driver of Cope's rule.
