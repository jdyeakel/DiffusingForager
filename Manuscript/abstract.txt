We introduce a minimal foraging model that incorporates two classes of
foragers: nutritionally replete foragers that can procreate, and
undernourished and non-procreating foragers that are susceptible to
mortality.  As a function of the transition rates between these replete and
undernourished states that are determined by the presence or absence of
resources, as well as the replenishment rate of the underlying resource, the
forager populations can either undergo cyclic dynamics or reach a steady
state.  By appplying basic allometric considerations, we obtain strong
constraints on these transition rates and thereby find that the population
dynamics that is subject to these constraints is typically driven to a steady
state.  As a further consequence of this viewpoint, we find that
allometrically constrained rates fall within a `refuge' in parameter space,
where the probability of extinction of the consumer population is minimized.
Thus our model provides a mechanism that may both drive and constrain natural
animal populations.  We also find that our model provides a natural framework
to determine a natural size for animal populations by examining the relative
stability of a otherwise homoegeneous population to a mutant population of a
different size.  For body masses $\lesssim 10^6$g, a more massive invader
dominates over the resident population, and vice versa for body mass $\gtrsim
10^6$g, thus providing a simple principled mechanism for Cope's rule.
